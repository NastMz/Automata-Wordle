# Automata Wordle UI
Automata Wordle is a simple, fun, and engaging word guessing game inspired by the popular online game Wordle. The game is built using Astro, a modern front-end framework for building fast, optimized web applications.  

## Features
- Guess a hidden word by typing letters.
- Each letter in the word is represented by a tile on the game board.
- The game provides feedback on your guesses:
  - Green: The letter is in the correct position.
  - Yellow: The letter is in the word but not in the correct position.
  - Gray: The letter is not in the word.
- The game ends when you have correctly guessed all the letters in the word or when you have exhausted all your attempts.

## Usage
To play the game, is necessary to run both the backend and frontend services. See this [README](https://github.com/NastMz/Automata-Wordle/blob/main/README.md) for more details.
